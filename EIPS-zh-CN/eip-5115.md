## 摘要

This standard proposes an API for wrapped yield-bearing tokens within smart contracts. This standard proposes an API for wrapped yield-generating tokens within smart contracts. It is an extension on the [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) token that provides basic functionality for transferring, depositing, withdrawing tokens, as well as reading balances.

## 动机

Yield generating mechanisms are built in all shapes and sizes, necessitating a manual integration every time a protocol builds on top of another protocol’s yield generating mechanism.

[EIP-4626](./eip-4626.md) tackled a significant part of this fragmentation by standardizing the interfaces for vaults, a major category among various yield-generating mechanisms.

In this EIP, we’re extending the coverage to include assets beyond EIP-4626’s reach, namely:

- Yield-generating assets that have different base tokens used for minting vs accounting for the pool value.
  - This category includes AMM liquidity tokens (which are yield generating assets that yield swap fees) since the value of the pool is measured in “liquidity units” (for example, $\sqrt k$ in UniswapV2, as defined in UniswapV2 whitepaper) which can’t be deposited in (as they are not tokens).
  - This extends the flexibility in minting the yield-bearing assets. This extends the flexibility in minting the yield-bearing assets. This extends the flexibility in minting the yield-bearing assets. For example, there could be an ETH vault that wants to allow users to deposit cETH directly instead of ETH, for gas efficiency or UX reasons.
- Assets with reward tokens by default (e.g. COMP rewards for supplying in Compound). Assets with reward tokens by default (e.g. COMP rewards for supplying in Compound). The reward tokens are expected to be sold to compound into the same asset. Assets with reward tokens by default (e.g. COMP rewards for supplying in Compound). The reward tokens are expected to be sold to compound into the same asset. Assets with reward tokens by default (e.g. COMP rewards for supplying in Compound). The reward tokens are expected to be sold to compound into the same asset.
- This EIP can be extended further to include the handling of rewards, such as the claiming of accrued multiple rewards tokens.

While EIP-4626 is a well-designed and suitable standard for most vaults, there will inevitably be some yield-generating mechanisms that do not fit into their category (LP tokens for instance). A more flexible standard is required to standardize the interaction with all types of yield generating mechanisms. A more flexible standard is required to standardize the interaction with all types of yield generating mechanisms. A more flexible standard is required to standardize the interaction with all types of yield generating mechanisms. A more flexible standard is required to standardize the interaction with all types of yield generating mechanisms.

Therefore, we are proposing Super Composable Yield (SCY), a flexible standard for wrapped yield generating tokens that could cover most mechanisms in DeFi. We foresee that: We foresee that: We foresee that: We foresee that:

- EIP-4626 will still be a popular vault standard, that most vaults should adopt.
- SCY tokens can wrap over most yield generating mechanisms in DeFi, including EIP-4626 vaults for projects built on top of interest-bearing tokens.
- Whoever needs the functionalities of SCY could integrate with the existing SCY tokens or write a new SCY (to wrap over the target interest-bearing token).
- Reward handling can be extended from the SY token.

### Use Cases

This EIP is designed for flexibility, aiming to accommodate as many yield generating mechanisms as possible. Particularly, this standard aims to be generalized enough that it supports the following uses cases and more: This EIP is designed for flexibility, aiming to accommodate as many yield generating mechanisms as possible.

## 规范

### Generic Yield Generating Pool

We will first introduce Generic Yield Generating Pool (GYGP), a model to describe most yield generating mechanisms in DeFi. In every yield generating mechanism, there is a pool of funds, whose value is measured in **assets**. There are a number of users who contribute liquidity to the pool, in exchange for **shares** of the pool, which represents units of ownership of the pool. The pool earns some **assets**. The **exchange rate** will simply increase due to the additional **assets.** The pool earns some **reward tokens**. The additional reward tokens will be distributed among the users.

Here are the more concrete definitions of the terms:

#### Definitions:

- **asset**: Is a unit to measure the value of the pool. **asset**: Is a unit to measure the value of the pool. **asset**: Is a unit to measure the value of the pool. At time *t*, the pool has a total value of *TotalAsset(t)* **assets**. **asset**: Is a unit to measure the value of the pool. **asset**: Is a unit to measure the value of the pool. At time *t*, the pool has a total value of *TotalAsset(t)* **assets**.
- **shares**: Is a unit that represents ownership of the pool. **shares**: Is a unit that represents ownership of the pool. At time *t*, there are *TotalShares(t)* **shares** in total.
- **reward tokens**: Over time, the pool earns $n_{rewards}$ types of reward tokens $(n_{rewards} \ge 0)$. **reward tokens**: Over time, the pool earns $n_{rewards}$ types of reward tokens $(n_{rewards} \ge 0)$. At time *t*, $TotalRewards_i(t)$ is the amount of ***reward token ***i****** that has accumulated for the pool up until time *t*. **reward tokens**: Over time, the pool earns $n_{rewards}$ types of reward tokens $(n_{rewards} \ge 0)$. At time *t*, $TotalRewards_i(t)$ is the amount of ***reward token ***i****** that has accumulated for the pool up until time *t*. **reward tokens**: Over time, the pool earns $n_{rewards}$ types of reward tokens $(n_{rewards} \ge 0)$. At time *t*, $TotalRewards_i(t)$ is the amount of ***reward token ***i****** that has accumulated for the pool up until time *t*.
- **exchange rate**: At time *t*, the **exchange rate** *ExchangeRate(t)* is simply how many **assets** each **shares** is worth $ExchangeRate(t) = \frac{TotalAsset(t)}{TotalShares(t)}$
- **shares**: Is a unit that represents ownership of the pool. **shares**: Is a unit that represents ownership of the pool. At time *t*, there are *TotalShares(t)* **shares** in total. Until time *t*, user *u* is entitled to receive a total of $rewards_{u_i}(t)$ ***reward token ***i******. The sum of all users’ shares, assets and rewards should be the same as the total shares, assets and rewards of the whole pool.

#### State changes:

1. A user withdraws **assets** from the pool, by burning their **shares**, proportionally to the asset amount being burned compared to the value of the pool A user withdraws **assets** from the pool, by burning their **shares**, proportionally to the asset amount being burned compared to the value of the pool A user withdraws **assets** from the pool, by burning their **shares**, proportionally to the asset amount being burned compared to the value of the pool $d_s = d_a / ExchangeRate(t)$ new **shares** will be created and given to user (or removed and burned from the user when $d_a$ is negative).
2. The pool earns $d_a$ (or loses $−d_a$ if $d_a$ is negative) **assets** at time $t$. The **exchange rate** simply increases (or decreases if $d_a$ is negative) due to the additional assets. The **exchange rate** simply increases (or decreases if $d_a$ is negative) due to the additional assets. The **exchange rate** simply increases (or decreases if $d_a$ is negative) due to the additional assets.
3. The pool earns $d_r$ **reward token** $i$. Every user will receive a certain amount of **reward token** $i$. Every user will receive a certain amount of **reward token** $i$. Every user will receive a certain amount of **reward token** $i$.

### Super Composable Yield Token Standard

#### Overview

Standardized Yield (SY) is a token standard for any yield generating mechanism that conforms to the GYGP model. Super Composable Yield is a token standard for all GYGPs. Each Super Composable Yield token represents **shares** in a GYGP and allows for interacting with the GYGP via a standard interface Super Composable Yield is a token standard for all GYGPs. Each Super Composable Yield token represents **shares** in a GYGP and allows for interacting with the GYGP via a standard interface Super Composable Yield is a token standard for all GYGPs. Each Super Composable Yield token represents **shares** in a GYGP and allows for interacting with the GYGP via a standard interface

All SCY tokens:

- **MUST** implement **`EIP-20`** to represent shares in the underlying GYGP.
- **MUST** implement EIP-20’s optional metadata extensions `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`, which **SHOULD** reflect the underlying GYGP’s accounting asset’s `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals`.
- **MAY** implement [EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) to improve the UX of approving SCY tokens on various integrations.
- **MAY** revert on calls to `transfer` and `transferFrom` if a SCY token is to be non-transferable.
- The EIP-20 operations `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `totalSupply`, etc. **SHOULD** operate on the GYGP “shares”, which represent a claim to ownership on a fraction of the GYGP’s underlying holdings.

#### SY Definitions:

On top of the definitions above for GYGPs, we need to define 2 more concepts:

- **input tokens**: Are tokens that can be converted into assets to enter the pool. Each SY can accept several possible input tokens $tokens_{in_{i}}$ Each SY can accept several possible input tokens $tokens_{in_{i}}$ Each SY can accept several possible input tokens $tokens_{in_{i}}$

- **output tokens**: Are tokens that can be redeemed from assets when exiting the pool. Each SY can have several possible output tokens $tokens_{out_{i}}$ Each SY can have several possible output tokens $tokens_{out_{i}}$ Each SY can have several possible output tokens $tokens_{out_{i}}$

        uint256 minSharesOut
    ) external returns (uint256 amountSharesOut);

    function redeem(
        address receiver,

}
```

#### Methods

```solidity
function deposit(
    address receiver,
    address tokenIn,
    uint256 amountTokenToPull,
    uint256 minSharesOut
) external returns (uint256 amountSharesOut);
```

This function will deposit *amountTokenToDeposit* of input token $i$ (*tokenIn*) to mint new SY shares.

If *depositFromInternalBalance* is set to *false*, msg.sender will need to initially deposit *amountTokenToDeposit* of input token $i$ (*tokenIn*) into the SY contract, then this function will convert the *amountTokenToDeposit* of input token $i$ into $d_a$ worth of **asset** and deposit this amount into the pool for the *receiver*, who will receive *amountSharesOut* of SY tokens (**shares**). If *depositFromInternalBalance* is set to *true*, then *amountTokenToDeposit* of input token $i$ (*tokenIn*) will be taken from receiver directly (as msg.sender), and will be converted and shares returned to the receiver similarly to the first case. If *depositFromInternalBalance* is set to *true*, then *amountTokenToDeposit* of input token $i$ (*tokenIn*) will be taken from receiver directly (as msg.sender), and will be converted and shares returned to the receiver similarly to the first case. If *depositFromInternalBalance* is set to *true*, then *amountTokenToDeposit* of input token $i$ (*tokenIn*) will be taken from receiver directly (as msg.sender), and will be converted and shares returned to the receiver similarly to the first case.

This function should revert if $amountSharesOut \lt minSharesOut$.

- **MUST** emit the `Deposit` event.
- **MUST** support EIP-20’s `approve` / `transferFrom` flow where `tokenIn` are taken from receiver directly (as msg.sender) or if the msg.sender has EIP-20 approved allowance over the base token of the receiver.
- **MUST** revert if $tokenOut \lt minTokenOut$ (due to redeem limit being reached, slippage, or the user not approving enough `amountSharesToPull` **to the SCY contract, etc).
- **MUST** emit the `ClaimRewards` event.

```solidity
function redeem(
    address receiver,
    uint256 amountSharesToPull,
    address tokenOut,
    uint256 minTokenOut
) external returns (uint256 amountTokenOut);
```

This function will redeem the $d_s$ shares, which is equivalent to $d_a = d_s \times ExchangeRate(t)$ assets, from the pool. The $d_a$ assets is converted into exactly *amountTokenOut* of output token $i$ (*tokenOut*). The $d_a$ assets is converted into exactly *amountTokenOut* of output token $i$ (*tokenOut*). The $d_a$ assets is converted into exactly *amountTokenOut* of output token $i$ (*tokenOut*).

If *burnFromInternalBalance* is set to *false*, the user will need to initially deposit *amountSharesToRedeem* into the SY contract, then this function will burn the floating amount $d_s$ of SY tokens (**shares**) in the SY contract to redeem to output token $i$ (*tokenOut*). This pattern is similar to UniswapV2 which allows for more gas efficient ways to interact with the contract. If *burnFromInternalBalance* is set to *true*, then this function will burn *amountSharesToRedeem* $d_s$ of SY tokens directly from the user to redeem to output token $i$ (*tokenOut*). This pattern is similar to UniswapV2 which allows for more gas efficient ways to interact with the contract. If *burnFromInternalBalance* is set to *true*, then this function will burn *amountSharesToRedeem* $d_s$ of SY tokens directly from the user to redeem to output token $i$ (*tokenOut*). This pattern is similar to UniswapV2 which allows for more gas efficient ways to interact with the contract. If *burnFromInternalBalance* is set to *true*, then this function will burn *amountSharesToRedeem* $d_s$ of SY tokens directly from the user to redeem to output token $i$ (*tokenOut*).

This function should revert if $amountTokenOut \lt minTokenOut$.

- **MUST** emit the `Redeem` event.
- **MUST** support EIP-20’s `approve` / `transferFrom` flow where the shares are burned from receiver directly (as msg.sender) or if the msg.sender has EIP-20 approved allowance over the shares of the receiver.
- **MUST** revert if $amountSharesOut \lt minSharesOut$ (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, or the user not approving enough `tokenIn` **to the SCY contract, etc).

```solidity
function claimRewards(address user) external returns (uint256[] memory rewardAmounts);
```

This method updates and returns the latest **exchange rate**, which is the **exchange rate** from SCY token amount into asset amount, scaled by a fixed scaling factor of 1e18.

- **MUST** return $ExchangeRate(t_{now})$ such that $ExchangeRate(t_{now}) \times scyBalance / 1e18 = assetBalance$.
- **MUST NOT** include fees that are charged against the underlying yield token in the SCY contract.

```solidity
function isValidBaseToken(address token) external view returns (bool);
```

This read-only method returns the list of all base tokens that can be used to deposit into the SCY contract.

- **MUST** return EIP-20 token addresses.
- **MUST** return at least one address.
- **MUST NOT** revert.

```solidity
function exchangeRateStored() external view returns (uint256);
```

This read-only method returns the latest list of all reward tokens.

- **MUST** return EIP-20 token addresses.
- **MUST** return at least one address.
- **MUST NOT** revert.

```solidity
function yieldToken() external view returns (address);
```

This read-only method returns the underlying yield-generating token (representing a GYGP) that was wrapped into a SCY token.

- **MUST** return a token address that conforms to the EIP-20 interface, or zero address
- **MUST NOT** revert.
- **MUST** reflect the exact underlying yield-generating token address if the SCY token is a wrapped token.
- **MAY** return 0x or zero address if the SCY token is natively implemented, and not from wrapping.

```solidity
function getRewardTokens() external view returns (address[] memory);
```

This read-only method returns the amount of shares that a user would have received if they deposit *amountTokenToDeposit* of *tokenIn*.

- **shares**: Is a unit that represents ownership of the pool. At time *t*, there are *TotalShares(t)* **shares** in total.
- **MUST NOT** revert.

```solidity
function getBaseTokens() external view returns (address[] memory);
```

This read-only method returns the amount of *tokenOut* that a user would have received if they redeem *amountSharesToRedeem* of *tokenOut*.

- **MAY** return additional reward tokens over time, depending on when `underlyingYieldToken` supports more or less reward tokens.
- **MUST NOT** revert.

#### Events

```solidity
event Deposit(
    address indexed caller,
    address indexed receiver,
    address indexed tokenIn,
    uint256 amountDeposited,
    uint256 amountScyOut
);
```

`caller` has converted exact base tokens into SCY (shares) and transferred those SCY to `receiver`.

- **MUST** be emitted when base tokens are redeemed from the SCY contract via `redeem` method.

```solidity
event Redeem(
    address indexed caller,
    address indexed receiver,
    address indexed tokenOut,
    uint256 amountScyToRedeem,
    uint256 amountTokenOut
);
```

`caller` has converted exact SCY (shares) into base tokens and transferred those base tokens to `receiver`.

- **MUST** be emitted when base tokens are deposited into the SCY contract via `deposit` method.

**"SCY" Word Choice:**

"SCY" (pronunciation: */sʌɪ/*), an abbreviation of Super Composable Yield, was found to be appropriate to describe a broad universe of composable yield-bearing digital assets.

## 基本原理

[EIP-20](./eip-20.md) is enforced because implementation details such as transfer, token approvals, and balance calculation directly carry over to the SCY tokens. This standardization makes the SCY tokens immediately compatible with all EIP-20 use cases. [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) is enforced because implementation details such as transfer, token approvals, and balance calculation directly carry over to the SCY tokens. This standardization makes the SCY tokens immediately compatible with all EIP-20 use cases. This standardization makes the SY tokens immediately compatible with all EIP-20 use cases.

[EIP-165](./eip-165.md) can optionally be implemented should you want integrations to detect the IStandardizedYield interface implementation.

[EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) can optionally be implemented in order to improve the UX of approving SCY tokens on various integrations.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation extends the functionality of [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), however the optional metadata extensions, namely `name`, `decimals`, and `symbol` semantics MUST be implemented for all SCY token implementations.

## Security Considerations

Malicious implementations which conform to the interface can put users at risk. Malicious implementations which conform to the interface can put users at risk. Malicious implementations which conform to the interface can put users at risk. It is recommended that all integrators (such as wallets, aggregators, or other smart contract protocols) review the implementation to avoid possible exploits and users losing funds.

`yieldToken` must strongly reflect the address of the underlying wrapped yield-bearing token. `yieldToken` must strongly reflect the address of the underlying wrapped yield-generating token. For a native implementation wherein the SCY token does not wrap a yield-generating token, but natively represents a GYGP share, then the address returned MAY be a zero address. Otherwise, for wrapped tokens, you may introduce confusion on what the SCY token represents, or may be deemed malicious. Otherwise, for wrapped tokens, you may introduce confusion on what the SY token represents, or may be deemed malicious.
