## Simple Summary
Specify an Ethereum address range occupied by precompiles and future system contracts. Regular accounts and contracts cannot obtain such an address. Specify an Ethereum address range occupied by precompiles and future system contracts. Regular accounts and contracts cannot obtain such an address. Regular accounts and contracts cannot obtain such an address.

## 摘要
The address range between 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ffff is reserved for precompiles and system contracts.

## 动机
This will simplify certain future features where unless this is implemented, several exceptions must be specified.

## 规范
The address range between 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000ffff is reserved for precompiles and system contracts.

Due to the extremely low probability (and lack of adequate testing possibilities) no explicit checks should be added to ensure that external transaction signing or the invoking of the `CREATE` instruction can result in a precompile address.

## 基本原理
N/A

## Backwards Compatibility
No contracts on the main network have been created at the specified addresses. As a result it should pose no backwards compatibility problems. As a result it should pose no backwards compatibility problems.
