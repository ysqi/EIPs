## Simple Summary

This EIP defines standard interfaces and behaviors for token contracts.

## 摘要

This standard defines a new way to interact with a token contract while remaining backward compatible with [ERC-20][].

It defines advanced features to interact with tokens. It defines advanced features to interact with tokens. Namely, *operators* to send tokens on behalf of another address&mdash;contract or regular account&mdash;and send/receive *hooks* to offer token holders more control over their tokens.

It takes advantage of [ERC-1820][] to find out whether and where to notify contracts and regular addresses when they receive tokens as well as to allow compatibility with already-deployed contracts.

## 动机

This standard tries to improve upon the widely used [ERC-20][] token standard. The main advantages of this standard are: The main advantages of this standard are:

1. Uses the same philosophy as Ether in that tokens are sent with `send(dest, value, data)`.

2. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which token they send by registering a `tokensToSend` hook. (Rejection is done by `revert`ing in the hook function.) (Rejection is done by `revert`ing in the hook function.)

3. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which token they receive by registering a `tokensReceived` hook. (Rejection is done by `revert`ing in the hook function.) (Rejection is done by `revert`ing in the hook function.)

4. The `tokensReceived` hook allows to send tokens to a contract and notify it in a single transaction, unlike [ERC-20][] which requires a double call (`approve`/`transferFrom`) to achieve this.

5. The holder can "authorize" and "revoke" operators which can send tokens on their behalf. The holder can "authorize" and "revoke" operators which can send tokens on their behalf. These operators are intended to be verified contracts such as an exchange, a cheque processor or an automatic charging system.

6. Every token transaction contains `data` and `operatorData` bytes fields to be used freely to pass data from the holder and the operator, respectively.

7. It is backward compatible with wallets that do not contain the `tokensReceived` hook function by deploying a proxy contract implementing the `tokensReceived` hook for the wallet.

### ERC777Token (Token Contract)

``` solidity
interface ERC777Token {
    function name() external view returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address holder) external view returns (uint256);
    function granularity() external view returns (uint256);

    function defaultOperators() external view returns (address[] memory);
    function isOperatorFor(
        address operator,
        address holder
    ) external view returns (bool);
    function authorizeOperator(address operator) external;
    function revokeOperator(address operator) external;

    function send(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function operatorSend(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external;

    function burn(uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function operatorBurn(
        address from,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata data,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external;

    event Sent(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed from,
        address indexed to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );
    event Minted(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );
    event Burned(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed from,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes data,
        bytes operatorData
    );
    event AuthorizedOperator(
        address indexed operator,
        address indexed holder
    );
    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed holder);
}
```

The token contract MUST implement the above interface. The implementation MUST follow the specifications described below. The implementation MUST follow the specifications described below.

The token contract MUST register the `ERC777Token` interface with its own address via [ERC-1820][].

> This is done by calling the `setInterfaceImplementer` function on the [ERC-1820][] registry with the token contract address as both the address and the implementer and the `keccak256` hash of `ERC777Token` (`0xac7fbab5f54a3ca8194167523c6753bfeb96a445279294b6125b68cce2177054`) as the interface hash.

If the contract has a switch to enable or disable ERC777 functions, every time the switch is triggered, the token MUST register or unregister the `ERC777Token` interface for its own address accordingly via ERC1820. Unregistering implies calling the `setInterfaceImplementer` with the token contract address as the address, the `keccak256` hash of `ERC777Token` as the interface hash and `0x0` as the implementer. (See [Set An Interface For An Address][erc1820-set] in [ERC-1820][] for more details.) Unregistering implies calling the `setInterfaceImplementer` with the token contract address as the address, the `keccak256` hash of `ERC777Token` as the interface hash and `0x0` as the implementer. (See [Set An Interface For An Address][erc1820-set] in [ERC-1820][] for more details.)

When interacting with the token contract, all amounts and balances MUST be unsigned integers. I.e. internally, all values are stored as a denomination of 1E-18 of a token. The display denomination&mdash;to display any amount to the end user&mdash;MUST be 10<sup>18</sup> of the internal denomination.

In other words, the internal denomination is similar to a wei and the display denomination is similar to an ether. It is equivalent to an [ERC-20][]'s `decimals` function returning `18`. E.g. if a token contract returns a balance of `500,000,000,000,000,000` (0.5&times;10<sup>18</sup>) for a user, the user interface MUST show `0.5` tokens to the user. If the user wishes to send `0.3` tokens, the contract MUST be called with an amount of `300,000,000,000,000,000` (0.3&times;10<sup>18</sup>).

User Interfaces which are generated programmatically from the ABI of the token contract MAY use and display the internal denomination. But this MUST be made clear, for example by displaying the `uint256` type. But this MUST be made clear, for example by displaying the `uint256` type.

#### **View Functions**

The `view` functions detailed below MUST be implemented.

**`name` function**

``` solidity
function name() external view returns (string memory)
```

Get the name of the token, e.g., `"MyToken"`.

> <small>**identifier:** `06fdde03`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** Name of the token.</small>

**`symbol` function**

``` solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string memory)
```

Get the symbol of the token, e.g., `"MYT"`.

> <small>**identifier:** `95d89b41`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** Symbol of the token.</small>

**`totalSupply` function**

``` solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```

Get the total number of minted tokens.

*NOTE*: The total supply MUST be equal to the sum of the balances of all addresses&mdash;as returned by the `balanceOf` function.

*NOTE*: The total supply MUST be equal to the sum of all the minted tokens as defined in all the `Minted` events minus the sum of all the burned tokens as defined in all the `Burned` events.

> <small>**identifier:** `18160ddd`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** Total supply of tokens currently in circulation.</small>

**`balanceOf` function**

``` solidity
function balanceOf(address holder) external view returns (uint256)
```

Get the balance of the account with address `holder`.

The balance MUST be zero (`0`) or higher.

> <small>**identifier:** `70a08231`</small>  
> <small>**parameters**</small>  
> <small>`holder`: Address for which the balance is returned.</small>
> 
> <small>**returns:** Amount of tokens held by `holder` in the token contract.</small>

**`granularity` function**

``` solidity
function granularity() external view returns (uint256)
```

Get the smallest part of the token that's not divisible.

In other words, the granularity is the smallest amount of tokens (in the internal denomination) which MAY be minted, sent or burned at any time.

The following rules MUST be applied regarding the *granularity*:

- The *granularity* value MUST be set at creation time.

- The *granularity* value MUST NOT be changed, ever.

- The *granularity* value MUST be greater than or equal to `1`.

- All balances MUST be a multiple of the granularity.

- Any amount of tokens (in the internal denomination) minted, sent or burned MUST be a multiple of the *granularity* value.

- Any operation that would result in a balance that's not a multiple of the *granularity* value MUST be considered invalid, and the transaction MUST `revert`.

*NOTE*: Most tokens SHOULD be fully partition-able. *NOTE*: Most tokens SHOULD be fully partition-able. I.e., this function SHOULD return `1` unless there is a good reason for not allowing any fraction of the token.

> <small>**identifier:** `556f0dc7`</small>  
> <small>**returns:** The smallest non-divisible part of the token.</small>

*NOTE*: [`defaultOperators`][defaultOperators] and [`isOperatorFor`][isOperatorFor] are also `view` functions, defined under the [operators][] for consistency.

*[ERC-20][] compatibility requirement*:  
The decimals of the token MUST always be `18`. *[ERC-20][] compatibility requirement*:  
The decimals of the token MUST always be `18`. For a *pure* ERC777 token the [ERC-20][] `decimals` function is OPTIONAL, and its existence SHALL NOT be relied upon when interacting with the token contract. (The decimal value of `18` is implied.) For an [ERC-20][] compatible token, the `decimals` function is REQUIRED and MUST return `18`. (In [ERC-20][], the `decimals` function is OPTIONAL. If the function is not present, the `decimals` value is not clearly defined and may be assumed to be `0`. Hence for compatibility reasons, `decimals` MUST be implemented for [ERC-20][] compatible tokens.) (The decimal value of `18` is implied.) For an [ERC-20][] compatible token, the `decimals` function is REQUIRED and MUST return `18`. (In [ERC-20][], the `decimals` function is OPTIONAL. If the function is not present, the `decimals` value is not clearly defined and may be assumed to be `0`. Hence for compatibility reasons, `decimals` MUST be implemented for [ERC-20][] compatible tokens.)

#### **Operators**

An `operator` is an address which is allowed to send and burn tokens on behalf of some *holder*.

When an address becomes an *operator* for a *holder*, an `AuthorizedOperator` event MUST be emitted. The `AuthorizedOperator`'s `operator` (topic 1) and `holder` (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the *operator* and the *holder* respectively. The `AuthorizedOperator`'s `operator` (topic 1) and `holder` (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the *operator* and the *holder* respectively.

When a *holder* revokes an *operator*, a `RevokedOperator` event MUST be emitted. When a *holder* revokes an *operator*, a `RevokedOperator` event MUST be emitted. The `RevokedOperator`'s `operator` (topic 1) and `holder` (topic 2) MUST be the addresses of the *operator* and the *holder* respectively.

*NOTE*: A *holder* MAY have multiple *operators* at the same time.

The token MAY define *default operators*. The token MAY define *default operators*. A *default operator* is an implicitly authorized *operator* for all *holders*. `AuthorizedOperator` events MUST NOT be emitted when defining the *default operators*. The rules below apply to *default operators*: `AuthorizedOperator` events MUST NOT be emitted when defining the *default operators*. The rules below apply to *default operators*:

- The token contract MUST define *default operators* at creation time.

- The *default operators* MUST be invariants. The *default operators* MUST be invariants. I.e., the token contract MUST NOT add or remove *default operators* ever.

- `AuthorizedOperator` events MUST NOT be emitted when defining *default operators*.

- A *holder* MUST be allowed to revoke a *default operator* (unless the *holder* is the *default operator* in question).

- A *holder* MUST be allowed to re-authorize a previously revoked *default operator*.

- When a *default operator* is explicitly authorized or revoked for a specific *holder*, an `AuthorizedOperator` or `RevokedOperator` event (respectively) MUST be emitted.

The following rules apply to any *operator*:

- An address MUST always be an *operator* for itself. Hence an address MUST NOT ever be revoked as its own *operator*. Hence an address MUST NOT ever be revoked as its own *operator*.

- If an address is an *operator* for a *holder*, `isOperatorFor` MUST return `true`.

- If an address is not an *operator* for a *holder*, `isOperatorFor` MUST return `false`.

- The token contract MUST emit an `AuthorizedOperator` event with the correct values when a *holder* authorizes an address as its *operator* as defined in the [`AuthorizedOperator` Event][authorizedoperator].

- The token contract MUST emit a `RevokedOperator` event with the correct values when a *holder* revokes an address as its *operator* as defined in the [`RevokedOperator` Event][revokedoperator].

*NOTE*: A *holder* MAY authorize an already authorized *operator*. An `AuthorizedOperator` MUST be emitted each time. An `AuthorizedOperator` MUST be emitted each time.

*NOTE*: A *holder* MAY revoke an already revoked *operator*. A `RevokedOperator` MUST be emitted each time. A `RevokedOperator` MUST be emitted each time.

**`AuthorizedOperator` event** <a id="authorizedoperator"></a>

``` solidity
event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed holder)
```

Indicates the authorization of `operator` as an *operator* for `holder`.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of an *operator* authorization process.

> <small>**parameters**</small>  
> <small>`operator`: Address which became an *operator* of `holder`.</small>  
> <small>`holder`: Address of a *holder* which authorized the `operator` address as an *operator*.</small>

**`RevokedOperator` event** <a id="revokedoperator"></a>

``` solidity
event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed holder)
```

Indicates the revocation of `operator` as an *operator* for `holder`.

*NOTE*: This event MUST NOT be emitted outside of an *operator* revocation process.

> <small>**parameters**</small>  
> <small>`operator`: Address which was revoked as an *operator* of `holder`.</small>  
> <small>`holder`: Address of a *holder* which revoked the `operator` address as an *operator*.</small>

The `defaultOperators`, `authorizeOperator`, `revokeOperator` and `isOperatorFor` functions described below MUST be implemented to manage *operators*. Token contracts MAY implement other functions to manage *operators*. Token contracts MAY implement other functions to manage *operators*.

**`defaultOperators` function** <a id="defaultOperators"></a>

``` solidity
function defaultOperators() external view returns (address[] memory)
```

Get the list of *default operators* as defined by the token contract.

*NOTE*: If the token contract does not have any *default operators*, this function MUST return an empty list.

A call from the sender, using the <code>approve</code> function and a call from the recipient using <code>transferFrom</code>. Furthermore, this requires extra communication between the parties which is not clearly defined. Finally, holders can get confused between <code>transfer</code> and <code>approve</code>/<code>transferFrom</code>. Using the former to transfer tokens to a contract will most likely result in locked tokens.

>       The decision was made to keep this registry in a separate EIP, as to not over complicate this standard. More importantly, the registry is designed in a flexible fashion, such that other EIPs and smart contract infrastructures can benefit from it for their own use cases, outside the realm of <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> and tokens. The first proposal for this registry was <a href="./eip-820.md" fo="6">ERC-820</a>. Unfortunately, issues emanating from upgrades in the Solidity language to versions 0.5 and above resulted in a bug in a separated part of the registry, which required changes. This was discovered right after the last call period. Attempts made to avoid creating a separate EIP, such as <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1758" fo="7">ERC820a</a>, were rejected. Hence the standard for the registry used for <a href="./eip-777.md" fo="5">ERC-777</a> became <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a>. <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> and <a href="./eip-820.md" fo="6">ERC-820</a> are functionally equivalent. <a href="./eip-1820.md" fo="8">ERC-1820</a> simply contains the fix for newer versions of Solidity.

For obvious security reasons, the list of default operators is defined at the token contract creation time, and cannot be changed. Any holder still has the right to revoke default operators. One of the obvious advantages of default operators is to allow ether-less movements of tokens. Default operators offer other usability advantages, such as allowing token providers to offer functionality in a modular way, and to reduce the complexity for holders to use features provided through operators.

A call from the sender, using the <code>approve</code> function and a call from the recipient using <code>transferFrom</code>. Furthermore, this requires extra communication between the parties which is not clearly defined. Finally, holders can get confused between <code>transfer</code> and <code>approve</code>/<code>transferFrom</code>. Using the former to transfer tokens to a contract will most likely result in locked tokens. > If any hook is implemented, it MUST be called.
