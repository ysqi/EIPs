## Abstract

This EIP introduces a new opcode, `PAY(addr, val)`, that transfers `val` wei to the address `addr` without calling it. After `FORK_BLKNUM`, this opcode is added to the EVM. After `FORK_BLKNUM`, this opcode is added to the EVM.

## Motivation

Currently, to send ether to an address requires you to call a function of that address, which has a few issues. First of all, it opens a reentrancy attack vector, as the recipient can call back into the sender. Secondly, it opens a DoS vector, so parent functions must be cognizant of the possibility that the recipient will run out of gas or revert. Finally, the `CALL` opcode is needlessly expensive for simple ether transfers, as it requires the memory and stack to be expanded, the recipient's full data including code and memory to be loaded, and finally needs to execute a call, which might do other unintentional operations. Having a dedicated opcode for ether transfers solves all of these issues, and would be a useful addition to the EVM.

## Specification

| Parameter           | Value   |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| `FORK_BLKNUM`       | TBD     |
| `PAY_OPCODE`        | TBD     |
| `BASE_GAS_COST`     | `8600`  |
| `COLD_GAS_COST`     | `11100` |
| `CREATION_GAS_COST` | `32600` |

A new opcode is introduced: `PAY` (`PAY_OPCODE`), which:

- Pops two values from the stack: `addr` then `val`.
- Transfers `val` wei to the address `addr`.

The cost of this opcode is `BASE_GAS_COST` if `addr` is a warm account, `COLD_GAS_COST` if `addr` is a cold account that is already in the state trie, or `BASE_GAS_COST+CREATION_GAS_COST` if `addr` has not yet been added to the state trie.

## Rationale

### Gas pricing

The gas pricing is that of a `CALL` with a positive `msg.value`, but without any memory expansion costs or "gas sent with call" costs, with a gas reduction of `500` to compensate for the reduced amount of computation.

### Argument order

The order of arguments mimicks that of `CALL`, which pops `addr` before `val`. The order of arguments mimicks that of `CALL`, which pops `addr` before `val`. Beyond consistency, though, this ordering aids validators pattern-matching MEV opportunities, so `PAY` always appears immediately after `COINBASE`.

## Backwards Compatibility

Needs discussion.

## Security Considerations

Existing contracts should not rely on their balance being under their control, since it is already possible to send ether to an address without calling it, by creating a temporary contract and immediately `SELFDESTRUCT`ing it, sending the ether to an arbitrary address. However, this opcode does make this process cheaper for already-vulnerable contracts. However, this opcode does make this process cheaper for already-vulnerable contracts.
