## Abstract

This specification defines a cross-chain execution interface for EVM-based blockchains. Implementations of this specification will allow contracts on one chain to call contracts on another.

The specification defines two components: the "Cross Chain Relayer" and the "Cross Chain Executor". The Cross Chain Relayer lives on the calling side, and the executor lives on the receiving side. Calls sent to Cross Chain Relayers will move through a transport layer to Cross Chain Executor(s), where they are executed. Implementations of this specification must implement both components.

## Motivation

Many Ethereum protocols need to coordinate state changes across multiple EVM-based blockchains. These chains often have native or third-party bridges that allow Ethereum contracts to execute code. However, bridges have different APIs so bridge integrations are custom. Each one affords different properties; with varying degrees of security, speed, and control. Defining a simple, common specification will increase code re-use and allow us to use common bridge implementations.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

This specification allows contracts on one chain to send messages to contracts on another chain. There are two key interfaces that needs to be implemented:

- `CrossChainRelayer`
- `CrossChainExecutor`

The `CrossChainRelayer` lives on the origin chain. Users can share a single `CrossChainRelayer` or deploy their own.

The `CrossChainExecutor` lives on the destination chain and executes relayed calls. Users can share a single `CrossChainExecutor` or deploy their own.

### CrossChainRelayer

The `CrossChainRelayer` lives on the chain from which messages are sent. The Relayer's job is to broadcast calls through a transport layer to one or more `CrossChainExecutor` contracts.

#### Methods

**relayCalls**

Will relay a batch of `Call` structs to be executed by any `CrossChainExecutor`(s) that execute calls from this Relayer. The `gasLimit` is used as a limit on the executing side.

`CrossChainRelayer`s MUST emit the `RelayedCalls` event when a batch of calls is relayed.

`CrossChainRelayer`s MUST increment a `nonce` so that each batch of calls can be uniquely identified.

`CrossChainRelayer`s MUST return the `nonce` to allow callers to track the batch of calls.

`CrossChainRelayer`s SHOULD pass the `nonce` as well as the address of the `sender` in the call to `CrossChainExecutor` to uniquely identify the message on the receiving chain.

`CrossChainRelayer`s MAY require payment.

```solidity
struct Call {
  address target;
  bytes data;
}

interface CrossChainRelayer {
  function relayCalls(Call[] calldata calls, uint256 gasLimit) external payable returns (uint256 nonce);
}
```

```yaml
- name: relayCalls
  type: function
  stateMutability: payable
  inputs:
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
    - name: gasLimit
      type: uint256
  outputs:
    - name: nonce
      type: uint256
```

#### Events

**RelayedCalls**

The `RelayedCalls` event MUST be emitted by the `CrossChainRelayer` when `relayCalls` is called.

```solidity
interface CrossChainRelayer {
  event RelayedCalls(
    uint256 indexed nonce,
    address indexed sender,
    Call[] calls,
    uint256 gasLimit
  );
}
```

```yaml
- name: RelayedCalls
  type: event
  inputs:
    - name: nonce
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: sender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
    - name: gasLimit
      type: uint256
```

#### Error handling

**GasLimitTooHigh**

`CrossChainRelayer`s MAY revert with `GasLimitTooHigh` if the `gasLimit` passed to `relayCalls` is higher than the maximum gas limit accepted by the bridge being used.

```solidity
interface CrossChainRelayer {
  error GasLimitTooHigh(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 maxGasLimit
  );
}
```

### CrossChainExecutor

The `CrossChainExecutor` executes relayed calls. Developers must implement a `CrossChainExecutor` in order to execute messages on the receiving chain.

The `CrossChainExecutor` will execute a nonce only once, but may execute nonces in any order. This specification makes no ordering guarantees, because messages may travel non-sequentially through the transport layer.

#### Execution

`CrossChainExecutor`s SHOULD authenticate that the call has been performed by the bridge transport layer.

`CrossChainExecutor`s MUST NOT execute a batch of calls more than once.

**Calldata**

`CrossChainExecutor`s MUST append the ABI-packed (`nonce`, `sender`) to the calldata for each call being executed. It allows the receiver of the call to check the true `sender` of the transaction and use the `nonce` to apply any transaction ordering logic.

```solidity
interface CrossChainExecutor {
  bytes calldata = abi.encode(Call.data, nonce, sender); // Can also use abi.encodePacked
}
```

```yaml
- name: calldata
  type: bytes
  inputs:
    - name: Call.data
      type: bytes
    - name: nonce
      type: uint256
    - name: sender
      type: address
```

#### Error handling

**CallsAlreadyExecuted**

`CrossChainExecutor`s MUST revert if a batch of calls has already been executed and SHOULD emit `CallsAlreadyExecuted` custom error.

```solidity
interface CrossChainExecutor {
  error CallsAlreadyExecuted(
    uint256 nonce
  );
}
```

**CallFailure**

`CrossChainExecutor`s SHOULD revert with a `CallFailure` error if a call fails.

```solidity
interface CrossChainExecutor {
  error CallFailure(
    uint256 callIndex,
    bytes errorData
  );
}
```

#### Events

**ExecutedCalls**

`ExecutedCalls` MUST be emitted once calls have been executed.

```solidity
interface CrossChainExecutor {
  event ExecutedCalls(
    CrossChainRelayer indexed relayer,
    uint256 indexed nonce
  );
}
```

```yaml
- name: ExecutedCalls
  type: event
  inputs:
    - name: relayer
      indexed: true
      type: CrossChainRelayer
    - name: nonce
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
```

## Rationale

The `CrossChainRelayer` can be coupled to one or more `CrossChainExecutor`. It is up to bridges to decide how to couple the two. Users can easily bridge a message by calling `relayCalls` without being aware of the `CrossChainExecutor` address. Messages can also be traced by a client using the data logged by the `ExecutedCalls` event.

Calls are relayed in batches because it is such a common action. Rather than have implementors take different approaches to encoding multiple calls into the `data` portion, this specification includes call batching to take away any guess work.

Some bridges may require payment in the native currency, so the `relayCalls` function is payable.

Bridges relay messages in various ways, applications should be aware of how the bridge they rely on operates and decide if they want to enforce transaction ordering by using the `nonce`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification is compatible with existing governance systems as it offers simple cross-chain execution.

## Security Considerations

Bridge trust profiles are variable, so users must understand that bridge security depends on the implementation.
