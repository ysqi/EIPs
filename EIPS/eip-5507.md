## Abstract

This EIP adds refund functionality for initial token offerings to [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md). Funds are held in escrow until a predetermined time before they are claimable. Until that predetermined time passes, users can receive a refund for tokens they have purchased.

## Motivation

The NFT and token spaces lack accountability. For the health of the ecosystem as a whole, better mechanisms to prevent rugpulls from happening are needed. Offering refunds provides greater protection for buyers and increases legitimacy for creators.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### EIP-1155 Refund Extension

    /// @return block   The block beyond which the token cannot be refunded
    function refundDeadlineOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256 block);
}
```

## Rationale

`refundDeadlineOf` uses blocks instead of timestamps, as timestamps are less reliable than block numbers.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues were found.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.
